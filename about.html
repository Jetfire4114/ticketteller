<h2 class="about">What is Ticket Teller?</h2>
<p class="about">Ticket Teller is an online "<em>ticket blog</em>" of sorts that started back in 2012 finding and listing local ticket prices for events near downtown Orlando Florida. Since then, we've grown from being a small unbacked company to now a full blown corporation that looks at local venues and takes note of all the new shows, plays, or musicals that are, or will be, happening there and relays that information right here for all of you to see. Now, Ticket Teller looks forward to continuing this "trend" of upward groth in the company and gracfully looks forward to your return.</p>
